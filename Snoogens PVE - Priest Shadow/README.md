## Mouseover DoT Spread  
If you prefer not to toggle between ST/AOE yourself and fully rely on the Auto display in Hekili, I recommend you enable /xxxxx ShadowWordPain  
This will automatically spread Shadow Word: Pain on your mouseover target as long as they are in combat, which makes Hekili Auto aware of them.    
Note: Does not work on Target Dummies, as they are not in combat.  

## Automatic Target Cycling  
If you'd like the rotation to automatically swap targets based on what Hekili recommends, such as for spreading Dots etc, enable this under Targeting:
